# Project2018 

## *This respitory was created for a project which concerns Fisher's Iris Data Set.*
> Fisher's Iris [data set](https://github.com/MartynaMisk/Project2018/blob/master/data/irisdata.csv)

### The content of the respitory is as follow: 
### Background information 

In 1936 a British statistician and biologist named Ronald Fisher published a paper called 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' where he introduced the Fisher's Iris Data Set. The data set consist of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris; *Setosa, Versicolor & Virginica*. The [data](https://github.com/MartynaMisk/Project2018/blob/master/data/irisdata.csv) is organized into five columns **Sepal length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width and Species**.  

Here is where you include some sample code that then you will lik to the files inside this respitory where the whole code is

this readme should help you to stay on track
