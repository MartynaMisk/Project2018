# Project2018 

## *This respitory was created for a project which concerns Fisher's Iris Data Set.*
> Fisher's Iris [data set](https://github.com/MartynaMisk/Project2018/blob/master/data/irisdata.csv) that can be found in this respitory.

### The content of the respitory is as follow: 
### Background information 

In 1936 a British statistician and biologist named Ronald Fisher published a paper called 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' where he introduced the Fisher's Iris Data Set. The data set consist of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris; *Setosa, Versicolor & Virginica*. The [data](https://github.com/MartynaMisk/Project2018/blob/master/data/irisdata.csv) contains 150 records under 5 species which are organized into five columns **Sepal length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width and Species** measured in centimetres. 

This data set is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations graphs. In this respitory I will try to calculate the mean, max and minimum of each column and perform other analisis that I believe are interesting.

(Here is where you include some sample code that then you will lik to the files inside this respitory where the whole code is 
https://github.com/datasets-io/iris 
this readme should help you to stay on track DLT)
First I calculate the *mean* of each column, sample code can be seen below. More information in folder [MEAN.py](https://github.com/MartynaMisk/Project2018/blob/master/MEAN.py). Snapshot of Data analysis using library numpy through programme ipython.
```
meanfirstcolumn = numpy.mean(data[:,0])
```
Then I caculate *maximum* and *meanimum* of each column, sample code cab be seen below. More information in MAXMIN.
```

##### Summary of the investigation 
Explain with what code 'loop' & 'for statment' you were able to calculate the mean, max and minimum of each column. I was bale to seperate the columns into each specy identigying the ...
