Reserch on Fisher's Iris Data

# The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. (this is a straight copy so ensure to rewrite it and perhaps add suggesitons on how you will evaluate it )

3 species are measured 
-	Setosa
-	Versicolor
-	Virginica

The data set consists of 150 iris plants, with 50 plants from each of three species
The data is measured in millimeters and organed into 5 columns which include 
Sepal length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width and Species 

There is few graphs (visualization) you can pull from this data set â€“

Can we organize the data into
